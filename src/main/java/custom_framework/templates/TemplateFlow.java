     * The Flow Classes live in pageWorkflows folder
     * Workflow Classes extend the respective pageElementUI class because they are specific to a single page
     * Workflows that cross multiple pages can be found in app specific CommonFlows
     *
     * Workflows should
     * -- be organized in alphabetical order
     * -- be as small as possible in order to remain modular and reusable
     * -- remain clean, i.e., free of error checks and asserts
     * -- be confined to the page it is specific to
     *
     * Naming convention
     * Workflows should be named after the specific function. Acceptable verbs include:
     * -- add, choose, complete, configure, delete, disable, enable, enter, update, validate
     *
     * When breaking down workflows into reusable pieces - create private methods
     * Put these in their own section at the bottom of the class, organized in alphabetical order
     * The private method section should be delineated by 10 EQUAL signs ==================== PRIVATE METHODS ====================
     *
     * Private methods are used by Public Methods
