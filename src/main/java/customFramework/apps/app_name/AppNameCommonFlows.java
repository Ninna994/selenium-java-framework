      ********** COMMON FLOWS **********
      This class is where we store commonly used workflows to reference in other tests
      The flows in this class should:
      1. be in alphabetical order
      2. be prefaced with the word "go" so each flow reads like a command, e.g., "goDoSomething"
      3. call the original workflow
      4. when necessary, be overloaded for ease of use
